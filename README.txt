# INTRODUCTION

All of the code and data required to reproduce the results in my report can be found on GitHub here:

https://github.com/chris-lundberg/ml_assignment_four

# CODE

All of the code required to perform the experiments cited in my PDF analysis submission is contained in the file `assignment_four_code.ipynb`, which is in the main directory of the GitHub repository cited above.

# ANALYSIS

The PDF analysis was generated using RMarkdown. The file `clundberg7-analysis.Rmd`, which is in the main directory of the GitHub repository cited above, contains all the code that generates the plots and text in the PDF report.

# DATA

The `.csv` files in the GitHub repository contain the data generated by the experiments detailed in the Jupyter notebook (the only `.ipynb` file in the repository). The `.Rmd` file that generates the report reads these files in and uses the data contained in these files to generate the plots in the PDF report.
